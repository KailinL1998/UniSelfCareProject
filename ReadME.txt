This is the required three screen APP that collects and presents answers to a bunch of questions from users. 
After opening the project, start it by entering 'expo start' in terminal.

If encountering 'module_not_found' errors, can try to install packages below:
	npm install react-navigation
	expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view
	npm install react-navigation-stack
	npm install formik
	npm install @react-native-community/picker --save
	npm install yup

Thank you for taking your time playing with this APP!!
